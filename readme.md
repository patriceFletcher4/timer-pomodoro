#Timer_pomodoro
I am building a timer web application using:
  - HTML
  - Bootstrap
  - jQuery
  - NodeJS for serving the application

###User Stories:
  1. As a user, when I navigate to the page I see a 25 minute Timer.
  2. As a user, my options for use is a START, PAUSE and BREAK button.
  3. As a user, when the start button is enabled I can click it.
  4. As a user, when I click the start button, the timer counts down to 0.
  5. As a user, when the pause button is enabled I can click it.
  6. As a user, when I click the pause button, the timer stops.
  7. As a user, when I click the pause button again, the timer continues to counts down to 0.
  8. As a user, when the break button is enabled I can click it.
  9. As a user, I see a 'tooltip' for the break button.
